## 🧠 What is FriendFrenzy?

**FriendFrenzy** is a private, anonymous, friends-only polling platform designed for college students and close friend groups.

One person (the creator) sets up a poll, shares a unique link with friends, and everyone votes anonymously on fun, playful, and slightly spicy questions.

No accounts.  
No identities.  
No awkward confrontations.

Just vibes, votes, and chaos.
